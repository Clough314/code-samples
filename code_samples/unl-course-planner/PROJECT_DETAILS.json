	"description" : "There were 4 significant parts to this project: an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool to pull data from the UNL APIs into our own custom databse, a PHP middle layer controller, a frontend written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with jQuery/AJAX to display things, and documentation done in 2 phases. The first phase was following Waterfall design principles, then the second phase was following Agile design principles. My primary contributions pertained to the ETL tool and documentation.
