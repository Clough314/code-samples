These are all small personal or class projects.

`unl-course-planner` is a group project for a software engineering course. It ran on a LAMP stack and implemented a UI for organizing a four year course plan. We used Selenium to scrape course data off of UNL's catalog and partially automate DB population.

`card.py` defines a class used to interface with a hardware card. The class implements echo validation to ensure that commands are recieved on the card's end of the serial connection.

`chort.py` is a short script to generate printable chore charts from predefined lists / repetition intervals. A library is used for astronomical calculations.

`topo_sort` contains three implementations of the same topological sort algorithm. One is in OCaml, one in Haskell, and one in Cool which is the minimal OOP language used in compiler construction courses. The Haskell version is easily the cleanest of the three.

`tic-tac-toe` is a script using a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play a non-trivial tic-tac-toe variant in a simple GUI.
